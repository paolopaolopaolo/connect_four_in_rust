# Connect 4 (in Rust)

## About

I made an implementation of Connect 4 in 2022 in order
to learn Rust, as I heard it was an up and coming language.

This game exists entirely within the command line and has
an extremely rudimentary game engine.

## How to build

In project root,
```
cargo clean && cargo build --release
```

## How to run (after building)
```
./target/release/connect_four
```
